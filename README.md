This repository contains series of smaller group projects written for STAT212: Introduction to Statistics course. The projects lead to the last 4th project where you can see the finalized version of the project for the course. In that project we intend to study the results of the NREEC survey performed with the residents of Northfield as the intended population. As we viewed the data we want to research if “Does the opinion of Northfield residents about equal employment opportunities for people of all races and ethnicities differ by race?” And “Does the importance of residents believing that Northfield should be welcoming to various backgrounds impact how safe residents feel?” . The data collection for this survey was broadcasted to Northfield residents through a variety of organizations and social media.
